#!/bin/bash
gcc $CFILE -E -o c

Explanation
The Bash script consists of two lines of code. The first line starts with #!/bin/bash, which is called a shebang. It tells the shell which interpreter to use to execute the script. In this case, it specifies that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.

The second line of the script uses the gcc command to compile a C file. The $CFILE variable is used to specify the name of the C file to be compiled. The -E option tells gcc to stop after the preprocessing stage and output the result to a file called c. The -o option specifies the output file name.

In summary, the Bash script compiles a C file into a preprocessed file using the gcc command. The preprocessed file is named c
